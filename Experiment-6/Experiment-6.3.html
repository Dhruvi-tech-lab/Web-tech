    Single Mode Fiber 
    </h1> 
    <p> 
    Single-mode fiber is a common type of optical fiber that is used to 
    transmit over longer distances. It is one of the two optical fiber 
    types, the other being multi-mode fiber. transmit a

    <h1> 
    Multi Mode Fiber 
    </h1> 
    <p> 
    Multi-mode fiber is a type of optical fiber designed to carry multiple 
    light rays or modes simultaneously, each at a marginally comparatively 
    over longer common type different reflection angle inside the optical 
    fiber core. Multi-mode fiber is mainly used to transmit across shorter 
    distances, as the modes are more likely to disperse extents. This 
    phenomenon is known as modal dispersion. Another of optical fiber is the 
    single-mode fiber, which is used mainly for longer distances.

    <h1> 
    Step Index Fiber 
    </h1> 
    <p> 
    For an optical fiber, a step-index profile is a refractive index profile 
    characterized by a uniform refractive index within the core and a sharp 
    decrease in refractive index at the core-cladding interface so that the 
    cladding is of a lower refractive index.

    <div class="item1"> 
    <h1> 
    Graded Index Fiber 
    </h1> 
    <p> 
    Graded Index fiber is another type of optical fiber in which the 
    refractive index of the core is non-uniform. This non-uniformity is 
    present because the refractive index is higher at the axis of the core 
    and continuously reduces with the radial movement away from the axis.
